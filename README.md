# Kickstarter-ML-Project

Crowdfunding has bbecome a prominent practice of funding a project or a venture by raising money from interested people across the globe. Kickstarter has hosted more than 250,000 projects on their website with more than $4 Billion collective amount raised.

While the amount of projects  on Kickstarter grow everyday, the reality is that not every project is able to reach the goal. Infact, on KickStarter, only about 35 percent of the total projects have raised successful fundings in the past. This fact raises an important question - which projects are able to successfully achieve their goal?. In other words, can project owners somehow know what are the key project characteristics that increases the chances of success?

In this project, we have tried to predict the success of a given campaign by taking into account the various information available about it.
Does it matter where the campaign owner is located? How long the campaign was online on Kickstarter, before the funding period started? Are certain categories such as tech more succesful in securing funding than creative projects such as music?

We have used several machine learning algorithm to answer the key questions related to the success (or failure) of any crowdfunding project. The focus in this approach is to make use of model behaviours and characteristics given by the project itself.
